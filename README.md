# Project-03
This is my 3rd HTML &amp; CSS project, created as part of my learning journey at Sheryians Coding School. In this project, I focused on improving my front-end development skills. This project reflects my progress in understanding web design fundamentals and writing clean, organized code. I will continue improving it as I learn more advanced concepts.
If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to share! 😊
